# PHP Webhosting Apps

This repository contains a collection of small applications for PHP web hosting, specifically tailored for platforms like DreamHost. Each application is designed to be self-contained and can be used independently. I do not consider this as a full-fledged framework or CMS or secure enough for production use. However, they can be a good starting point or reference for building your own web applications on PHP.

Use-cases for these apps are:
1. You are building a startup and don't have millions in funding to use a cloud platform.
2. You want to host your own web apps on DreamHost or any other PHP hosting platform.
3. You want to learn how to build web apps on PHP and use them on dreamhost like platforms.

## Applications

1. **filestore-api** - DreamHost doesn't provide a simple way to store files on their platform. This API provides an easy way to upload and download files from your own server. Does file expiration using cron job.
2. **Calendly like app** - Coming soon.

## Getting Started

To get started with these applications, follow the instructions below:

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the application you want to use.
3. Follow the specific instructions provided in each app's README file for setup and usage.
